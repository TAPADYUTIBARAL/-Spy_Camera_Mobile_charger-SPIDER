# -Spy_Camera_Mobile_charger-SPIDER
This main purpose of the project is made for home security. It will automatically record &amp; send the video clips, snaps, audio to the users when they are far away from home. Also we can use it by charging our mobiles &amp; other stuff (5V, 3.3V). Though its main purpose is security &amp; surveillance so itâ€™s product design is also very unique. It will be used for string operation and other purposes as well. Technical Part - A Raspberry pi zero board including TP 4056 module is used for li-ion mobile charging. The server &amp; protocol will be used for encrypted data transmission as well as fast image/video transfer. It will help to prevent data-lag.
